Assignment Overview

This group assignment, "Final Formal Iteration Deliverables," was prepared by Professor Tom Capaul.  
The goal of this assignment was to collaboratively continue working on the course project using "YouTrack" for project management, allowing the team to plan tasks and log the time spent on related activities regarding the final development of the course project.  
Additionally, the team implemented version control using "Git and GitHub" as part of the Final Formal Iteration Deliverables (or sprint).

During the completion of this assignment, the team faced several challenges:

1. Database and Pickling Integration:
   1.1. Integration of the working source code to get the connection to the database to work is overwhelming.
   1.2. Paying attention to relative and absolute paths.
   1.3. The team's database and pickling integration is the final development phase of the course project that is still a work in progress.
   1.4. Overall, despite these challenges, the team is dedicated and eager to make it work and deliver the final course project output in a timely manner.

Deliverables

Day 1:
   - Each team member reviewed and verified each other's work and discussed project improvements via Discord.  
   - Worked on synchronizing class relationships and functionalities to ensure the program is playable according to the team’s game design and mechanics.

Day 2:
   - Continued reviews and verification of each other's work, discussing project improvements via Discord.
   - Downloaded a copy of the repo. 
   - Tried to rewrite the controller and battle mechanics to fit the console-based UI.
   - Separated code into directories.
   - Continued to work on synchronizing class relationships and functionalities to ensure the program is playable according to the team’s game design and mechanics.

Day 3:
   - Continued reviews and verification of each other's work, discussing project improvements via Discord.  
   - Fixed some database connection issues, refactored the controller, console UI, and battle class.
   - Continued to work on synchronizing class relationships and functionalities to ensure the program is playable according to the team’s game design and mechanics.

Day 4:
   - During the team meeting via Zoom and Google Meet (from 6 PM to around 8 PM):
     - Walkthrough of the meeting agenda
     - Discussion and presentation:
       - Database
       - Pickling
       - Synchronized consolidated working source code
       - Demonstration of the playable program
   - After the meeting:
     - Continued refining the synchronization of class relationships and functionalities to ensure the program is playable according to the team’s game design and mechanics.

Day 5:
   - Continued reviews and verification of each other's work, discussing project improvements via Discord.  
   - Refactored, reorganized, and re-implemented the database and pickles.
   - The database is working, and things aren't broken.
   - Final touches on the synchronization of class relationships and functionalities to ensure the program is playable according to the team’s game design and mechanics.
   - Uploaded the synchronized team’s consolidated working source code to GitHub, which will be integrated with the database and pickling.
   - Summarized the course project MVC design patterns compliance and posted it on the YouTrack task card.
