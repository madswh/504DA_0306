TCSS 504 A Wi 25: Software Engineering and Development Techniques

Team Name: Team Awesome

Team Members:

- Jannine G. D. MacGormain  

Assignment Overview

This course project, "Dungeon Adventure 2.0," was prepared by Professor Tom Capaul.  
The goal of this project was to enhance skills in software engineering and development techniques, including project management using "YouTrack," collaboration, software design, unit testing, and coding standards.  
Key components include building a Software Requirements and Specifications (SRS) document, creating UML class diagrams, implementing an MVC design pattern, and using version control with Git and GitHub.  

During the completion of this assignment, the team faced several challenges:  

1. Boss mechanic: final boss broke, database connection-related issues.  
2. Mock controller bugs and cheat-win issues.  
3. Monsters' malfunctions: not dying after reaching negative hit points.  
4. Passing the connection object broke the save function.  
5. Game controller functionalities broke, database connection-related issues.
